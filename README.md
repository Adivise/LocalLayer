**LocalLayer** is a cross-platform desktop app (Windows, macOS, Linux) that allows creators to display localhost-based web content in a standalone window for easy capture in streaming or recording software.

It was created to solve a common issue where tools like **TikTok Live Studio** do not support capturing localhost URLs directly. **LocalLayer** acts as a bridge, making local web overlays usable in live streaming workflows.

# How to Use

2. Configure your overlay settings.
3. Click to Create Overlays.
4. Capture the overlay window in your streaming or recording software (e.g., TikTok Live Studio).
5. (Optional) Save your configuration as a preset for later use.
